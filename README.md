# ReRegMSStoreApps
A GUI Application to RE-register Microsoft Store apps. I made it so that apps that could not update via the store could be fixed with this GUI. It also solves the error "Could not start UWP app" or the issue where nothing happens when you try to open a specific app.

The code for this app is very crappy and not optimised. It takes around 5-10 seconds to load all the apps before you can action them. I will keep optimising it. Feel free to help out.
